# STHAL-Location-mention-Identification-in-Tweets-of-Indian-context

This is an official project repository of STHAL: Location mention Identification in Tweets of Indian context application built on the concept of **Named Entity Recognition**. As a result of our work, we prepare a publicly-available annotated  dataset  of  Indian  geolocations  that can be used by the research comm

The project is maintained by [Shobhit Sinha](https://github.com/Shobhs13), [Kartik Verma](https://github.com/vkartik2k). 

The dataset for can be found out at [Dataset](https://github.com/vkartik2k/STHAL/tree/main/Dataset). Please note that this is an implementation only for research purpose use only.

The Code consist of three models mainly Conditional Random Fields [(CRF)](https://github.com/vkartik2k/STHAL), [Bi-LSTM-CNN](https://github.com/vkartik2k/STHAL/tree/main/Bi-LSTM-CNN) and [BERT](https://github.com/vkartik2k/STHAL/tree/main/BERT). If your are interested in the concept of Fine-grained location identification, I have written on STHAL (to be released soon).
